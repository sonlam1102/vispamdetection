abstract="The reviews of customers play an essential role in online shopping. People often refer to reviews or comments of previous customers to decide whether to buy a new product. Catching up with this behavior, some people create untruths and illegitimate reviews to hoax customers about the fake quality of products. These are called spam reviews, confusing consumers on online shopping platforms and negatively affecting online shopping behaviors. We propose the dataset called ViSpamReviews, which has a strict annotation procedure for detecting spam reviews on e-commerce platforms. Our dataset consists of two tasks: the binary classification task for detecting whether a review is spam or not and the multi-class classification task for identifying the type of spam. The PhoBERT obtained the highest results on both tasks, 86.89{\%}, and 72.17{\%}, respectively, by macro average F1 score.",
